This is my program to calculate compound interest. Compund interest is so named becuase the principle and the interest both compund.  Over a long time, the compunding of the interest is much greater than the compunding of the principle.  This can be seen in the output of the program where compounding at 2% produces just $1000 over 40 years, whereas compounding at 20% produces $1.4 million = 1,440 times as much for just 10 times differnce in the intrest rate.
